		<h3>I am humbled and excited for all that there is to learn</h3>
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a generalist. There is no way around this:

		<li>I am not a confused person, nor this means I won't be able to do more complex tasks in any of the areas above.</li>

		<li>I devour everything I can learn. My passion about learning has lead me from one area to another, never forgeting what I have learned, but integrating and exponenciating the new knowledge with the previous one. Want an example? Standardizing and automating spreadsheets to make social media reports.  </li>

		<li>Changing areas doesn't mean I am bored. It usually comes out of feeling the need to complement the knowledge that I have with new skills to add a new dimension to my work.</li>

		<li>By being able to look at a project from dofferent angles, I try to integrate the culture and purpose of the organization into everything that I do, from the bigger tasks to the smaller ones, independently of the type of work I am doing.</li>
