          <p>
            My name is Ana Sofia and I am a Portuguese Industrial Engineer turned into a Digital Marketeer... And a PR, Multimedia Designer, Customer Support Manager and I even dabbed into Future Studies.
          </p>
          <p>
             Since I graduated in 2007, the world opened up in many unexpected ways and I had the privilege of working in all of these areas, — many of them simoultaneously, — throughout all the jobs that I had. I love to work and I love to learn, I am a generalist.
          <p>
             In the past 4 years, I have been working with several organizations to promote diversity in tech, such as Rails Girls, Girls Lean In, Geekettes and more recently, Rails Girls Summer of Code.
          </p>
          <p>Looking forward to work in tech, diversity, sustainability and/or health. If you know of any cool projects, let me know! :)</p>

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Work is love.</strong> For me, it's incredibly motivating to think about how we as human beings can make this world a better place through our work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether I am working as a social media strategist, content creator or project manager, using the <strong>multidisciplinary knowledge</strong> I have gained throughout the years <strong>enables me to bring something new</strong> to my work and hopefully <strong>connect people within and outside the organization</strong>.
