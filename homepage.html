          <p>
            My name is Ana Sofia and I am a Portuguese Industrial Engineer turned into a Digital Marketeer... And a PR, Multimedia Designer, Customer Support Manager and I even dabbed into Future Studies.
          </p>
          <p>
             Since I graduated in 2007, the world opened up in many unexpected ways and I had the privilege of working in all of these areas, — many of them simoultaneously, — throughout all the jobs that I had. I love to work and I love to learn, I am a generalist.
          <p>
             In the past 4 years, I have been working with several organizations to promote diversity in tech, such as Rails Girls, Girls Lean In, Geekettes and more recently, Rails Girls Summer of Code.
          </p>
          <p>Looking forward to work in tech, diversity, sustainability and/or health. If you know of any cool projects, let me know! :)</p>

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Work is love.</strong> For me, it's incredibly motivating to think about how we as human beings can make this world a better place through our work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether I am working as a social media strategist, content creator or project manager, using the <strong>multidisciplinary knowledge</strong> I have gained throughout the years <strong>enables me to bring something new</strong> to my work and hopefully <strong>connect people within and outside the organization</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here you will find my most recent and relevant work experience. If you would like to know more or see my cv or portfolio, please <strong>send me an email to me@anasofiapinho.com</strong>.

      <h1 class="ui header">Marketing Strategist and Project Manager at Change !t</h1>
      <p>
        Change !t is a non-profit organization focused on celebrating change and creating a happier society. It was founded by the Portuguese TV host and actress Ana Rita Clara.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of the relaunch of Change !t's website and social media, I was in charge of redesigning the website and creating the social media strategy and content. Other than this, in order to improve the workflow of the organization, I also organized and structured all the data and content created, with complementary documentation and tutorials.

      <h1 class="ui header">Ambassador and Community Manager at Geekettes</h1>
      <p>
        Portugal Geekettes is a chapter of Geekettes, an organization founded by Jess Erickson and Denise Philipp in Berlin. This organization empowers women to pursue their carreer in tech by providing workshops, tools and access to a community of women interested in tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        As one of the Ambassadors of Geekettes, I have had the pleasure to start the Portuguese hub back in 2014 when Geekettes expanded to several countries. Since then, I have been organizing events, moderating panels and live stream interviews, speaking at events and creating content for Portugal, Berlin and Global Geekettes Facebook Pages.
