          <h3 class="ui header">Hey there!</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Ana Sofia and I am a Portuguese Industrial Engineer turned into a Digital Marketeer... And a PR, Multimedia Designer, Customer Support Manager and I even dabbed into Future Studies.
          </p>
          <p>
             Since I graduated in 2007, the world opened up in many unexpected ways and I had the privilege of working in all of these areas, — many of them simoultaneously, — throughout all the jobs that I had. I love to work and I love to learn, I am a generalist.
          <p>
             In the past 4 years, I have been working with several organizations to promote women in tech, such as Rails Girls, Girls Lean In, Geekettes and more recently, Rails Girls Summer of Code.
          </p>
          <p>Looking forward to work in tech, diversity, sustainability and/or health. If you know of any cool projects, let me know! :)</p>

      <p>Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive, monolithic and worth your attention.</p>
