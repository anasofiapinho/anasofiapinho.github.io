        <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is a 3 months global scholarship that sponsors women to contribute full-time to Open Source Projects with the help of coaches and mentors. Since 2013, RGSoC has trained 145 students, raised more than 450.000 USD and created a community of over 800 students, coaches, mentors, supervisors and organizers.

        My main areas of responsibility were operations, support, marketing, pr and multimedia design. <br> Aditionally, it was common to participate in other tasks, like testing the RGSoC Teams App or being part of the selection commitee.

        <p><strong>MARKETING AND DESIGN</strong></p>
        <p>Looking at the RGSoC's stats on facebook, twitter and mailchimp, I realised that, just like any other organization, the team didn't have enough time to focus on communication and creating content. However, RGSoC has one thing that many organizations wish they had: an incredible community that believes in you and in what you do.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Main goals</strong></p>
        <p>
        * Connecting, even more, the people who are part of the organization with the people that are part of RGSoC (students, former students, mentors, coache, sponsors and coaching companies)<br>
        * Make sure that the content was easily associated with the brand, so that it would be more easily recognizable<br>
        * Creating content that was both authentic and fun, making people feel excited about the posts and consequently shared them <br>
        * Grow the number of followers organically and a strong foundation to reach even more people the following years
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>What we achieved in numbers</strong></p>
        <p>Regarding Twitter, I am happy to say that in less than a year, <b>RGSoC's account increased its impressions by 500%</b>. In May of 2016, the impressions broke all the records, reaching 37 times the impressions of May from the previous year. This was due to the <i>Thank You Board Crowdfunding Campaign</i> that I'll go through later in this section. <br>
        Overall the number of followers went up by 150%, while the number of tweets increased 163%.</p>
        <p>On Facebook, if we compare 2015 and 2016, <b>the post engagement was up 10 times and the number of followers rose over 2 times</b>. While the top posts on Twitter were related to the <i>Thank You Board Crowdfunding Campaign</i>, the top posts on Facebook were related with the launch of the applications, alumna interviews, albums of events during the program and useful tips for the summer of code.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Crafting Content</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>During the program, we have several stages that require announcements on social media, newsletters and blog posts. These stages are project submission announcements, applications for students, crowdfunding campaign, kick-off of the summer of code and so on.</p>

        <p>Gifs, gifs and more gifs! Every gif has a story and function behind it.</p>
        <p>
        Like when we were receiving so many messages, emails and tweets about when the applications would be opened, so I decided to film myself running towards the computer to express that excitement and rush when we finally announced the applications were open.<br>
        Or that sunday when applications closed and we got almost twice the number of applications from last year. I had to do something special to celebrate with everyone, so I basically made the gif in 10 minutes to post just after the applications' phase closed.<br>
        Last but not the least, the gif with all the programming languages! This came about in the RGSoC reunion in Portugal where we discussed the need to show everyone that RGSoC is not just about Rails projects, but all the other languages too!</p>

          <br>
          <p>RGSoC had build a press page in 2013, however it hadn't been updated and the team decided to remove it from the website. In 2016 we decided to redesign it, create press releases and organize the content into new sections. These sections had links to press releases ready to be downloaded and media, such as logos, images and videos.</p>

        <p><i class="quote left icon"></i>I met Ana Sofia Pinho through a common acquaintance who was a student and volunteer of our summer program Rails Girls Summer of Code. Throughout her work for RGSoC from March 1st to September 30th 2016, I had the opportunity to work closely with her as part of the team I managed. As part of her work responsibilities, Ana was in charge of marketing and PR as well as primary communication (customer support) with our students and sponsors.</p>
        <p>Ana is a very creative and hands-on person. In her time as a team member of RGSoC, she created beautiful targeted content for our audience and was incredibly helpful and empathetic to everyone she communicated with, including students and sponsors. She loves helping people and always goes the extra mile to do so. She is able to work independently, and brings enthusiasm and dedication to her work.</p>
        <p>I recommend Ana for a position in marketing, customer support, or anything that involves creativity and/or customer interaction.<i class="quote right icon"></i></p>
