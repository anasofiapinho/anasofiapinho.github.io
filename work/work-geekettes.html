        <p><strong>More than everything, I loved working for RGSoC.</strong> It was an absolute pleasure working with this incredible team and having such a powerful purpose behind everything was pure inspiration.</p>
        <p>I believe that the "people first" philosophy of the organization and the focus it has on being inclusive created this welcoming environment which allowed ideas to flourish and to be turned into reality. In the end, it didn't matter if the team was remote and working from different timezones: we kicked-ass!</p>

          </div>
          <div class="eleven wide left column top aligned">
              <p>RGSoC is intrinsically connected to its community. Each and every person who is part of the program is at least one of the following: student, coach, mentor (aka project maintainer), supervisor, donor and organizer.
              <br>This means that RGSoC's work is dependent on the support of the community at all levels. And if RGSoC wants to grow, the community has to grow with it and be actively engaged.
              </p>
              <p>After 3 editions people and especially sponsors and individual donors might get fatigued or invest their money in another place. We needed to make sure everyone knew how important their support was for the program and the impact they had on the student's career advancements and in diversifying tech.</p>
              <p>Just like any other organization formed by volunteers, RGSoC's team didn't have enough time to focus on social media and creating content. This was harming their reach and interactions on social networks, the number of visits to the website and preventing them to get to a bigger audience of students, coaches, project maintainers, sponsors and individual donors.</p>
              <p><i class="hand spock icon"></i>The good news: RGSoC's community is awesome! RGSoC has one thing that many organizations wish they had: a supportive community that believes in them and in what they do. This could exponentiate the results of our efforts if we, for instance, improved the content on social media.</p>

            <p>Months before the any of the temas start coding on their first day of the program, the RGSoC's team has been through several stages where they selected the open source projects and teams, while, at the same time launched and managed a crowdfunding campaign.</p>
            <p>In terms of marketing and communication, each stage requires multiple social media announcements, complemented with newsletters, blog posts and direct emails. Besides all of this, one of the goals was to stir up the type of posts and create more brand awareness. And that's a lot of multimedia design work!</p>
            <p>"How can we make a big announcement bigger? What do our fans like to share? What have they been talking about and how can I play with that? What makes this more fun and surprising? What makes this feel more authentic? How can I translate the culture of the organization into this announcement?"</p>
            <p>These were some of the questions that just went through my mind some days before we had to make major announcements. I didn't want to make a typical post. These were annoucements that had to get to as many people as we could, because some of them have been dreaming of being part of a program like this. We needed to reach them!</p>

            <p>Well, everyone loves gifs, why don't we just make our gifs? And that's how I ended up in one gif and <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC/status/709415023580454912/photo/1">my cat</a> as well. The first one on the left was published a day after <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC/status/710098322057465857/photo/1">this one</a>. This idea came to me after receiving so many emails and messages about when the applications would be open that it just felt like we were in a running competition before we hear "Ready, Set, Go!".</p>
            <p>Besides making a lot of gifs, I worked on some images and quick tutorials to post on twitter and facebook, as the reach and impressions increase when we use media. I have also adapted them to other dimensions to be used on blog posts and newsletters. With the help of the team we were even able to translate the crowdfundic campaign tweets to dozens of languages and post them throughout the weeks.</p>
            <p>We broke the record of the number of applications registered: 92! We were able to increase reach by WHATEVER and impressions by WHATEVER on Twitter. Meanwhile our Facebook page surpassed all expectations and we rose WHATEVER in reach and interactions. Here are some statistics:</p>

            <p>Like I mentioned before, with time getting funding for the same project might become harder. Individual donors might think that the project has grown enough and we don't need their help, and sponsors might want to direct their money to other things. It is a challenge to keep things interesting and creating value for everyone involved.</p>
            <p>After the initial posts and the multiple annoucements in several languages, I believed that we could create a campaign to unite in one place everyone who is part of RGSoC, from students to coaches, mentors, donors and sponsors. They all contributed to the project and they made an impact in someone's life. And that's how the Thank You Board was born.</p>

            <p>The Thank You Board is a 1x1 meters sized board with 25x25 tiny quares with coordinates (that's 625 cards if you are wondering). It would begin covered with the "</>" symbol, as most of the people in tech recognise this as related to coding. This symbol would have 3 colours representing the current percentages of men, women and non-binary people in programming. The background would be light grey.</p>
            <p>Now this is when the fun begins! For each donation, I would add the twitter handle of the donor to a card saying "Thank you" and its coordinates. I would do the same for sponsors, but instead of just one card, I would write "Thank you" in a group of cards and send a picture of that group of cards to the company.</p>

            <p>The social media engagement insights skyrocketed. On one of the months, companies retweeted and we raised our impressions on twitter over 3000%. It was really hard work, but I believe it gathered everyone in one place and showed them that their donations matter and that we are really thankful for them. Hopefully they'll remember this during the next crowdfunding campaign.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately our goals to raise more money than last year weren't accomplished. The number of sponsors was almost the same but we raised WHATEVER percent less. However we were able to fund the same number of teams that we funded last year.</p>

            <p>RGSoC had build a press page in 2013, however it hadn't been updated and the team decided to remove it from the website. In 2016 we decided to redesign it, create press releases and organize the content into new sections. These sections had links to press releases ready to be downloaded and media, such as logos, images and videos.</p>

            <p>Regarding Twitter, I am happy to say that in less than a year, <b>RGSoC's account increased its impressions by 400%</b>. In May of 2016, the impressions broke all the records, reaching 37 times the impressions of May from the previous year. This was due to the <i>Thank You Board Crowdfunding Campaign</i> that I'll go through later in this section. <br>Overall the number of followers went up by 150%, while the number of tweets increased 163%.</p>
            <p>On Facebook, if we compare 2015 and 2016, <b>the post engagement was up 10 times and the number of followers rose over 2 times</b>. While the top posts on Twitter were related to the <i>Thank You Board Crowdfunding Campaign</i>, the top posts on Facebook were related with the launch of the applications, alumna interviews, albums of events during the program and useful tips for the summer of code.</p>

Throughout her work for RGSoC from March 1st to September 30th 2016, I had the opportunity to work closely with her as part of the team I managed. As part of her work responsibilities, Ana was in charge of marketing and PR as well as primary communication (customer support) with our students and sponsors.</p>
            <p>Ana is a very creative and hands-on person. In her time as a team member of RGSoC, she created beautiful targeted content for our audience and was incredibly helpful and empathetic to everyone she communicated with, including students and sponsors. She loves helping people and always goes the extra mile to do so. She is able to work independently, and brings enthusiasm and dedication to her work.</p>
            <p>I recommend Ana for a position in marketing, customer support, or anything that involves creativity and/or customer interaction.<i class="quote right icon"></i></p>
